== Simple Instructions ==
(If these don't work, look below)

1. Download wireshark source code, either via tarball or source control
2. At least run ./configure on wireshark source (no need to build it)
3. Set WIRESHARK environment variable to your wireshark source dir
   (such that epan/epan.h is a valid #include line)
4. Install Scons if you don't already have it
5. cd src; scons install

== Building on MacOS X ==

The build has been tested on MacOS X 10.7.4 with Xcode 4.2.  Wireshark needs to be
installed via Brew, although you *also* still need the wireshark source download that
matches the version installed by Brew.  After installing with Brew, you can run
./configure in the Wireshark source download to generate the config.h that matches
your environment and then set the WIRESHARK environment variable as you would given
the instructions above.  Once you have installed wireshark, generated config.h, and
set the WIRESHARK environment variable, the plugin should build as on linux.

== Dependencies / Requirements ==
This plugin should build on any posix-compliant system that looks like Linux or *BSD,
but is unlikely to build on MacOS X unless your environment is somewhat perfect.  This
will hopefully be resolved in the future.  It also does not currently build on windows
but this is not particularly difficult and will also be resolved in a future commit.

While you do not actually *need* a full Wireshark source tarball/checkout, it's the
easiest package to acquire which will provide the proper dependencies.  Realistically
the build process only needs the Wireshark headers, but unfortunately it needs the
config.h header which is only generated after you run configure.

As such, you generally need the following things:
 * A functional C build and link environment
 * Wireshark source code
 * pkg-config
 * glib2 libraries and headers
 * Scons (http://www.scons.org/)
