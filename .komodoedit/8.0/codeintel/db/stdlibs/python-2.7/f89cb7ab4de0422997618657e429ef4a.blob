<scope doc="This module contains functions that can read and write Python values in&#xA;a binary format. The format is specific to Python, but independent of machine architecture issues.  Not all Python object types are supported; in general, only objects whose value is independent from a particular invocation of Python can be written and read by this module. The following types are supported: None, integers, long integers, floating point numbers, strings, Unicode objects, tuples, lists, sets, dictionaries, and code objects, where it should be understood that tuples, lists and dictionaries are only supported as long as the values contained therein are themselves" ilk="blob" lang="Python" name="marshal">
